            What is a TimSort?
        </p>
        <p>
            Timsort is a hybrid, stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to
            perform well on many kinds of real-world data.</p>
        <p>
            Tim sort is an adaptive sorting algorithm that needs O(n log n) comparisons to sort an array of n elements.
            It was designed and implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 in a python programming language. It has been python's
            standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3. It is one of the fastest sorting algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic approach used in the Tim sort algorithm is - first divide the data into small chunks (preferably
            chunk sizes of 32 or 64) and solved these chunks by using the insertion sort and then merge all the big
            chunks using the merge function of the merge sort.

        <p>
            First sort small pieces using Insertion Sort, then merges the pieces using a merge of merge sort.
            We divide the Array into blocks known as Run. We sort those runs using insertion sort one by one and then
            merge those runs using the combine function used in merge sort. If the size of the Array is less than run,
            then Array gets sorted just by using Insertion Sort. The size of the run may vary from 32 to 64 depending
            upon the size of the array. Note that the merge function performs well when size subarrays are powers of 2.
            The idea is based on the fact that insertion sort performs well for small arrays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time Complexity: O(N log(N)), Sorting arrays on different machines. Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and
            time complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î¸(n)
